This repository contains the Geant(V4.10.0) scripts simulated for DAMIC ANTONELLA experiment.
ANTONELLA is a neutron calibration experiment, designed to calibrate silicon detectors to the nuclear recoil signal expected from dark matter.  We operated the experiment at a proton beam at U. Notre Dame, using a target and collimator to produce neutrons which were scattered from a silicon detector, and then detected in scintillating bars readout with PMTs.  In 2013, we operated a partially instrumented detector, and then used the results to run the full detector in 2015.  Our results from this experiment achieved energy calibrations in a never-before measured part of phase space, and have been published (F. Izraelevitch et al., 2017 JINST 12 P06014. arXiv:1702.00873.).
I should thank the community of Geant which proides so good resources like tutorials, examples and forum. Without those excellent documents, my simulation can't be accomplished. 
I also should thank senior physicist Dr. Gaston Gutierrez at Fermilab and Prof. Marco Antonio Reyes Santos from Mexico for many efficient and productive discussions.
