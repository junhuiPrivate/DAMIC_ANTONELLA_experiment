Every directory lines up to a specific sestup. The name of each directory is hopefully intuitive enough. The scripts in all directories have been debugged under Geant V4.10.0. Be attention to the verion of Geant.
I should thank Geant community which proides so good resources like tutorials, examples and forum. Without those excellent document, my simulation can't be finished. 
I also should thank senior physicist Dr. Gaston Gutierrez at Fermilab and Prof. Marco Antonio Reyes Santos from Mexico for many close discussions. Until now, I am still miss a lot the months we have worked together.
